# Developed under BaP Framework - v1.0.0
The idea is not to use any framework (JS, CSS, or whatever), just HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. The main concept is to test new ideas quickly and easily. It is not intended to be a full-featured framework, but a tool to help you develop your ideas. However, it is a robust and scalable framework that can be used to develop simple applications and perform even in production environments.

## Support 
This framework is developed to be supported by Google Firebase. 
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting
- Database: Firebase Realtime Database
- Analytics: Firebase Analytics
- Auth: Firebase Auth
- Recaptcha: Firebase AppCheck / Google cloud reCAPTCHA

You must to create a Firebase project and configure these values in the `src/_main/constants.js` file, and set de `CONSTANT.FIREBASE_AVAILABLE` with `true` value

0. `npm run server`: To start the local server with livereload and hotreload.
1. `npm run optimize`: Mandatory to optimize the code and generate the `public` folder with the optimized code before to deploy in QA or Production.
2. `npm run deploy-qa`: to deploy the app in the QA environment.
3. `npm run deploy-prod`: to deploy the app in the production environment.
